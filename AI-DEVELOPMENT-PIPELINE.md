#  AI-Enhanced Development Pipeline

## WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:

### 1. DEVELOPMENT PHASE:
        
   Human        Cursor         Git     
 Requirements       Assists          Commit    
        
                                            
                                            
### 2. AI REVIEW PHASE:                     
             
   Synthia      GitHub    
   Reviews          Webhook   
    
      
      
### 3. OPTIMIZATION PHASE:
        
   Synthia      Cursor       Deploy    
 Generates        Implements         Update    
Improvements       Changes                     
        

## CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT:
- Synthia monitors system performance 24/7
- Identifies bottlenecks and inefficiencies  
- Generates optimized code solutions
- Cursor implements with human oversight
- System continuously evolves and improves
