## 🚨 Issue: Buttons Not Working

If you're seeing buttons but they don't do anything when clicked, here's how to fix it:

## 🧪 Step 1: Test Basic Button Functionality

1. **Open the test file**: `button-test.html`
2. **Click each test button** to verify basic functionality works
3. **Check browser console** for any error messages

## 🔍 Step 2: Check Main Platform

1. **Open**: `index.html` in your browser
2. **Press F12** to open Developer Tools
3. **Go to Console tab** to see any JavaScript errors
4. **Look for error messages** that start with ❌

## 🛠️ Step 3: Common Fixes

### Fix 1: Browser Console Errors
- If you see JavaScript errors, the buttons won't work
- Check for syntax errors or missing functions

### Fix 2: File Loading Issues
- Make sure all files are in the same folder
- Check that `index.html` loads completely

### Fix 3: JavaScript Disabled
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Check browser settings for JavaScript permissions

## 🎯 Step 4: Test Specific Buttons

### Practice Panther Button
- Should show case list or demo data
- If it fails, check console for "Backend connection failed"

### F: Drive Button  
- Should show file/folder list or demo data
- If it fails, check console for "Backend F: drive access failed"

### Voice Control Buttons
- Should start/stop voice recognition
- Check if microphone permissions are granted

## 🔧 Step 5: Manual Testing

If buttons still don't work:

1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Type these commands manually**:
   ```javascript
   getCases()
   browseFDrive()
   searchCases()
   ```
3. **Check for error messages**

## 📱 Step 6: Mobile Testing

- Test on different devices
- Check if touch events work
- Verify mobile-optimized features

## 🚀 Step 7: Deployment Check

If testing locally:
- Use a local web server (not just opening the file)
- Try: `python -m http.server 8000` or `npx serve .`

## 📞 Need Help?

If buttons still don't work after these steps:
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Test with different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
3. Verify all files are in the correct location

## ✅ Success Indicators

When buttons work correctly, you should see:
- ✅ Console messages showing successful initialization
- ✅ Button clicks produce responses (alerts, data, etc.)
- ✅ No JavaScript errors in console
- ✅ All interactive elements respond to clicks

**Note**: The platform includes fallback demo data, so even without a backend connection, buttons should show sample information.
